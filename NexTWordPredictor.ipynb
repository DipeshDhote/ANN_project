Maybe 25.\\n', 'Human 2: Which holiday was that?\\n', 'Human 1: I think it was Australia\\n', 'Human 2: Do you still talk to the people you met?\\n', \"Human 1: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\\n\", 'Human 2: Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?\\n', 'Human 1: what do you mean?\\n', 'Human 2: I think it\\'s like a 6th sense, often seen as \"cold readings\" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again.\\n', \"Human 1: Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky\\n\", 'Human 2: There\\'s this practice called \"Treasure Hunting\" that\\'s kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There\\'s a book called \"The Ultimate Treasure Hunt\" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.\\n', 'Human 1: So, do you do treasure hunting often?\\n', \"Human 2: I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific.\\n\", 'Human 1: Hi\\n', 'Human 2: Any plans for the weekend?\\n', 'Human 1: my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!\\n', \"Human 2: That's great! How's the weather over the weekend? I hope its warm.\\n\", 'Human 1: Should be very sunny! you?\\n', 'Human 2: Cool! very depressing plans ... stay home and work üòû I have a project deadline very close.\\n', 'Human 1: üòê hope you get your work done very soon! a bug free weekend!\\n', 'Human 2: Right, very anxious! where do you plan to go for a hike?\\n', 'Human 1: I am going to Diablo!\\n', \"Human 2: Nice, where is that place? I haven't been there\\n\", 'Human 1: hours drive from here. still in bay area\\n', \"Human 2: That's cool! How long is the hike?\\n\", 'Human 1:  Actually no idea, but it will take the entire day for that.\\n', 'Human 2: nice! sounds fun!\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', \"Human 2: Hey there! What's up???\\n\", 'Human 1: Nothing much, how you doin?\\n', \"Human 2: I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D\\n\", 'Human 1: Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?\\n', 'Human 2: The last time in New York, back in June.\\n', \"Human 1: Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...\\n\", \"Human 2: Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently\\n\", 'Human 1: Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?\\n', \"Human 2: Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?\\n\", 'Human 1: Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!\\n', 'Human 2: What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?\\n', 'Human 1: Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?\\n', \"Human 2: I'd love to try! Can we schedule something for next week?\\n\", 'Human 1: Sure! What does your Saturday look like?\\n', 'Human 2: Saturday looks pretty good, shall we shoot for something in the morning?\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: hey\\n', 'Human 1: is it raining pretty bad today?\\n', 'Human 2: yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options\\n', \"Human 1: surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy\\n\", \"Human 2: yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here üòõ\\n\", 'Human 1: Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...\\n', \"Human 2: yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down\\n\", \"Human 1: Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms\\n\", 'Human 2: yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here\\n', 'Human 1: people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area\\n', \"Human 2: it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire\\n\", 'Human 1: hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?\\n', 'Human 2: nope, what does it say?\\n', 'Human 1: they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.\\n', 'Human 1: Hi.\\n', 'Human 2: Helloooooo!\\n', 'Human 1: How are you? How is your day?\\n', \"Human 2: Good. Don't have much to do today, feels good. How are you?\\n\", \"Human 1: I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.\\n\", \"Human 2: So what's your outlook? Something blue?\\n\", \"Human 1: Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?\\n\", 'Human 2: You should drink more water, do some push up, and sleep early.\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: Hey, how are you?\\n', \"Human 1: I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.\\n\", 'Human 2: Oh no‚Ä¶ Have you sent out the missing cat posters? Hope your cat is alright!\\n', \"Human 1: Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?\\n\", 'Human 2: Yea, I know they love the plastic bag sound all the time. I am good, nothing special though.\\n', 'Human 1: If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?\\n', 'Human 2: I like rainforest, but I know it requires extensive training beforehand.\\n', 'Human 1: I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.\\n', 'Human 2: I am afraid I will be scared of doing this :)\\n', \"Human 1: I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.\\n\", \"Human 2: I don't know if there is any medication for acrophobia. I want to take plenty of it if I really have to do it.\\n\", \"Human 1: If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions\\n\", \"Human 2: That's a great idea! Maybe alcohol is such a thing.\\n\", \"Human 1: Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!\\n\", \"Human 2: Oops. I won't do it again. Ha\\n\", 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: Hey sup\\n', 'Human 1: not much. any plans this weekend?\\n', \"Human 2: I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?\\n\", 'Human 1: ziplining?\\n', \"Human 2: that's the one! have you ever tried it?\\n\", \"Human 1: i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience\\n\", 'Human 2: where did you do it?\\n', \"Human 1: i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though\\n\", \"Human 2: no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?\\n\", \"Human 1: that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you\\n\", 'Human 2: sure. are you just going home now?\\n', \"Human 1: no, i'm going to get a massage first\\n\", 'Human 2: nice. what type?\\n', 'Human 1: traditional kind\\n', 'Human 2: yeah I want to get one too soon\\n', \"Human 1: you should! it's relaxing after a long day. talk to you later!\\n\", 'Human 2: ttyl!\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?\\n', \"Human 1: I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?\\n\", 'Human 2: I have never seen Avatar, what is it about? I really enjoy the Avenger movies\\n', \"Human 1: it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature\\n\", 'Human 2: That sounds really cool! I think that movie did really well when it was in the box office so it must be good!\\n', 'Human 1: yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?\\n', 'Human 2: I enjoy baking cookies. I am on a quest to bake the best chocolate chip cookie üôÇ What about you?\\n', 'Human 1: I enjoy eating üôÇ\\n', 'Human 2: so definitely would like to try your best chocolate cookie\\n', 'Human 1: I will have to bake some soon and let you know.

Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?\\n', \"Human 2: I prefer to go out. I'm not a good cook haha\\n\", 'Human 1: Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook\\n', 'Human 2: seems like we share a thing in common, yay!\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: Good afternoon!\\n', 'Human 1: How has your week been?\\n', 'Human 2: So far so good. It is holiday season. So just chilling\\n', \"Human 1: I think I'm getting sick with a cold üòû So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.\\n\", 'Human 2: lol Sorry to hear that. Are you planning anything fun for December?\\n', \"Human 1: Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.\\n\", 'Human 2: üòÇ\\n', 'Human 1: Do you have big plans?\\n', 'Human 2: Yes! I am going to Hawaii! This will be my first time visiting Hawaii. Really excited about it.\\n', \"Human 1: I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.\\n\", 'Human 2: lol this is the first time I heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion. I cannot agree more.\\n', \"Human 1: Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.\\n\", 'Human 2: üòÇ\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', \"Human 2: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?\\n\", 'Human 1: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?\\n', 'Human 2: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?\\n', \"Human 1: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.\\n\", 'Human 2: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.\\n', \"Human 1: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!\\n\", \"Human 2: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?\\n\", \"Human 1: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..\\n\", 'Human 2: Are you doing any home decorating then?\\n', 'Human 1: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.\\n', \"Human 2: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.\\n\", 'Human 1: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.\\n', 'Human 2: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?\\n', 'Human 1: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\\n', \"Human 2: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\\n\", 'Human 1: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\\n', \"Human 2: Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target.\\n\", 'Human 1: Great, I hope you find a nice tree.\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: Hey\\n', \"Human 1: How's your day going?\\n\", 'Human 2: pretty good. yours?\\n', \"Human 1: Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..\\n\", 'Human 2: oh what happened?\\n', \"Human 1: Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :')\\n\", 'Human 2: hahah wait for real?\\n', 'Human 1: I know right! Are you taking History next semester?\\n', \"Human 2: No I'm not in school anymore\\n\", 'Human 1: Oh I see. What do you do?\\n', 'Human 2: I train and compete in horse vaulting\\n', 'Human 1: Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?\\n', \"Human 2: lol you're too funny\\n\", 'Human 1: Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?\\n', 'Human 2: Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything\\n', 'Human 1: Wow, sounds very busy! Do you with money at those horse vaulting competitions?\\n', 'Human 2: Yeah some. enough to get by\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: Hello\\n', 'Human 1: Do you have a favourite flower?\\n', \"Human 2: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?\\n\", \"Human 1: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?\\n\", 'Human 2: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?\\n', \"Human 1: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.\\n\", 'Human 2: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?\\n', 'Human 1: The gerbera. It\\'s like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life.\\n', 'Human 2: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.\\n', 'Human 1: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?\\n', 'Human 2: yes\\n', \"Human 1: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila\\n\", 'Human 2: Hehe, i think you should publish this someday :)\\n', \"Human 1: Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!\\n\", 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', \"Human 2: Hey how's it going\\n\", \"Human 1: It's good it's good. How are you?\\n\", \"Human 2: good. it's really hot today. I think I'm going to the pool\\n\", 'Human 1: Oh nice! Where do you live?\\n', 'Human 2: I live in Tokyo, Japan\\n', 'Human 1: Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....\\n', 'Human 2: oh have you been?\\n', \"Human 1: Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!\\n\", 'Human 2: what did you do here?\\n', 'Human 1: Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha\\n', 'Human 2: lol why did you come to Japan just to go to Disney land?\\n', \"Human 1: The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!\\n\", \"Human 2: oh neat. I haven't heard about that robot fighting show. where is that??\\n\", 'Human 1: I don\\'t really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I\\'m sure you can find it if you google \"giant robot fighting show tokyo\" haha\\n', 'Human 2: lol ok\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: Have you seen any good movies lately?\\n', 'Human 1: Last weekend I saw \"The Parasite.\" Ever heard of it?\\n', 'Human 2: No. Why did you pick that movie?\\n', 'Human 1: My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?\\n', 'Human 2: I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.\\n', 'Human 1: Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!\\n', 'Human 2: Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol\\n', 'Human 1: lol Are you a big Marvel fan?\\n', 'Human 2: I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?\\n', \"Human 1: I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha\\n\", 'Human 2: Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.\\n', 'Human 1: Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha\\n', 'Human 2: Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome üòÄ\\n', \"Human 1: Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before\\n\", \"Human 2: He's the adopted brother of Thor, God of thunder, and is burdened with glorious purpose. Do you feel that burden?\\n\", 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', \"Human 2: Hey, what's up?\\n\", \"Human 1: Just chillin'. how are you?\\n\", \"Human 2: I'm pretty good, thanks.\\n\", 'Human 1: Do anything interesting today?\\n', 'Human 2: I went to the local cafe and had a double espresso. It was delicious. What about you?\\n', \"Human 1: Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!\\n\", 'Human 2: Oh my gosh. What was it like??\\n', \"Human 1: It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?\\n\", \"Human 2: No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.\\n\", \"Human 1: Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?\\n\", \"Human 2: No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.\\n\", \"Human 1: Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha\\n\", 'Human 2: Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?\\n', \"Human 1: Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?\\n\", 'Human 2: I think I sort of understand :)\\n', 'Human 1: Hi!\\n', 'Human 2: hello there, how is it going?\\n', 'Human 1: All good.

How are you doing?\\n', \"Human 1: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?\\n\", \"Human 2: I just got a matcha latte üôÇ Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity\\n\", \"Human 1: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?\\n\", \"Human 2: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise\\n\", \"Human 1: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?\\n\", 'Human 2: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch.

Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives\\n', 'Human 2: are there even any negatives? what are they? \\n', 'Human 1: Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :)\\n', \"Human 2: People can already impersonate other people though! I think it'd be great to have bots to converse with\\n\", 'Human 1: True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)\\n', 'Human 2: What do you think are the big advantages? Like personal assistants?\\n', 'Human 1: I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems üôÇ Sort of like stepping on the moon üôÇ I might be overselling it here üòõ\\n', \"Human 2: No, I agree -- it's such an exciting time to be alive to get to witness all this and be a part of it. I wonder if I'll be able someday to get a chatbot to just auto-suggest conversations for me\\n\", 'Human 1: The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good üôÇ\\n', \"Human 2: Yeah those are actually really good for a few words!

What matters to you the most in life?\\n', \"Human 1: Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?\\n\", \"Human 2: I'd say that I want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime. It's probably a result of my playing too many video games as a child.\\n\", \"Human 1: We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.\\n\", \"Human 2: Does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds and/or makes you feel a bit a distance from those who don't understand?\\n\", 'Human 1: It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?\\n', 'Human 2: I grew up in the United States, but my parents were immigrants and ended up being scammed of all their money, so we moved to Taiwan to live with family for a little bit.\\n', 'Human 1: ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?\\n', \"Human 2: I was kind of too young to really understand, but apparently there are people who scam Asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business. I know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized, and we didn't have insurance. To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental.

I have got a good mentor .\\n', 'Human 2: Wow, that is nice of you. For the mentor program, personally I prefer more 1:1 conversations than the group discussions.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
